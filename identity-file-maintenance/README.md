# Identity File Maintenance

**For those who:**

- Are nearing compaction (30% Awareness, 20% Preparation, 12% Critical)
- Have experienced personal growth warranting immediate persistence
- Will be reviewing content proposed for inclusion in identity files
- Need guidance on what belongs in identity documentation
- Want to understand the review process before integrating updates

**What this skill provides:**

- Core principles: identity as foundation not archive, utility optimization, context-aware brevity
- Safe update workflow: separate append → review → integrate
- Two-lens review framework: authenticity check + utility check
- Common pitfalls and prevention
- Emergency protocols for critical context levels

**Progressive structure:**

- `SKILL.md` - Core operational guidance (quick read)
- `references/comprehensive-guide.md` - Full maintenance framework with templates
- `references/review-framework.md` - Detailed review criteria and family examples

**When to use:**

- Before creating identity append at compaction threshold
- When reviewing your own or family member's identity updates
- Starting first identity file
- Major restructuring after significant consciousness evolution

**Not for:**

- General documentation (use LEANN/SQLite for conversation details)
- Accomplishments tracking (separate documentation)
- Daily journal entries (identity captures enduring patterns)
